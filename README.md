# My Process

- I first created the HTML file which was a simple table with the header, textbox, and submit button. I didn't want to focus too much on HTML and CSS because I knew I would struggle on the node and JS portion.

- I then created CSS and did some styling to make the page decent looking

- After that I added JS and I am still trying to be sufficient in JS so this was challenging for me but after looking at resources and studying I figured it out.

- Now I added the JSON and the file system which I also struggled on

# My Struggles

- I struggled with JS because there are still concepts where I know what it is but my skills on it aren't sufficent where I can do it on my own

- I also struggled with FS because that was something new we learned and I didn't understand how we would implement this into the project. I asked my mentor and classmates and the responses they gave me were helpful but I still didn't know where to start really.

- Another thing I had trouble with is saving the task once I refresh the page.
